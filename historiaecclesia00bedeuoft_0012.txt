have belonged to two tribes—the Angles and the Saxons ¹.

Orthe two English Britain was unequally divided between

tax-{³⁰32 the two. The Angles possessed the whole country

converted. and South Hampshire3 the Saxons all the south-
west portion of Britain, together with Middlesex and Essex.
Τὴθ Angles therefore were far more widely spread than the

Saxons.
Thus it happened that when Pope Gregorius undertook the

conversion of England, it was for Angles rather than Saxons
that his mission was intended. The slave-boys in the Roman
market-place had been Angles from Deira : and it so happened
that the readiest path to the beart of England lay through an
Angle prince; for AEthelberht of Kent had already married a
Christian, and was at that moment tolerating Christian worship
in the city where he resided. The Grospel received a courteous
hearing in Kent (A.D. 597), and its missionaries began to think
of new conquests. Stin it is in Angle kingdoms that it is most
tolerantly received. Eorpwald of East Anglia was baptized
before A.D. 626. When Paulinus preached in N orthhumbria,

¹ It will be observed that no room
is left in this classification for the
J ntes, who are classed with the
Angles. This is done after much
deliberation, the following being, in

,at least more closely akin to the
Angles than to the Saxons.

Ι. The authori-ties which are most
nearly contemporary favour this clas-
sifieation. The poet of Beowulf
(according to Kemble nearly con·-
temporaneous with the events he
relates) makes Hengest an Eoten or
J ute, and makes him come from
‘ Ongle.' Nennius represents him
as anAngle. Against this is to be
set the fact that Ethelwerd assigns
a local habitation to the Gioti north
of Anglia: and that Geographus

Ravennas (seventh century) speaks
of Anschis as a Saxon.

2. The Angles of N orthhumbria
seem to have been specially akin
to the J utes of Kent. N ennius
(M.H.B. p. 75) represents Soemil
who invaded N orthhumbria as Hen-
gest’s grandfather: and before Ida
took the title of king in Bernicia,
A.D. 547, Lappenberg,'i. 119, thinks
that the Northhumbrians had been⁸
governed by the kings of Kent. It
was directly from Kent to N orth-
humbria that Christianity mamhed,
and when WVulfhere of Mercia in-
vaded Wessex, A.D. 661, the only
districts that he subdued and re-
tained were Wiht ,and Mean, the
two Angle colonies among the West
Saxons. See p. 239, note 5.
