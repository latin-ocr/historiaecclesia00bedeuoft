EPISTOLA AD ECGBEROTUM ANTISTITEM.

1. ILEOTISSIMO ac reverentissimo antistiti Egbercto 1

Baeda famulus Christi salutem. Memini te hesterno
dixisse anno, cum tecum aliquot diebus legendi gratia in mona-
sterio tuo demorarer, quod hoc etiam anno velles, cum in eundem
devenires locum, me quoque, ob commune legendi studium, ad

tuum accire colloquium.

Quod si ita, Deo volente, posset

impleri, non opus esset tibi haec per literas scripta dirigere3
cum possem liberius ore ad os loquens, quaeque vellem, sive
necessaria ducerem, secreta tibi allocutione suggerere. Verum
quia hoc ne fieret, superveniens, ut nosti, corporis mei valitudo

¹ Eybercto] Brother of Eadberht
the Northhumbrian king, A.D. 737-
758, and first cousin of Cenred and
Ceolwulf‚ Eadberht’s predecessors.
He was placed in a monastery by
his father, Eata, while yet an infant;
and was made deacon at· Rome,
where he lost his brother Ecgred.
He was made bishop of York in A.D.
732, after Wilfrith113 and in A.D.
735, by receiving a pall at Rome,
gained for his See the title of an
archiepiscopate‚ which it had been
denied since the time of Paulinus.
Malmesbury praises him highly:
‘ qui et sua prudentia, et germani
potentia, sedem illam in canonicum
statum reformavit. . . . Hic omnium
liberalium artium armarium, ut ita
dicam, et sacrarium fuit: nobilis-

simamque bibliothecam Eboraci con-
stituit ;' Gest. Reg. i. ξ 65. Alcwine,
the friend of Karl the Great, was a
disciple of his, and calls him ‘magister
meus dilectus Egbertus archiepisco-
pus.’ Malmesb. id. He wrote a dia-
logue ‘ De Institutione Ecclesiastica:
a treatise ‘ De J ure Sacerdotali,’ and
an ‘Opus Poenitentiale,' in four books.
He died Nov. 19, A.D. 766.

This letter appears to have been
Beda’s last work. We find that he
was already weakened by his mortal
illness, p. 392, that the pall had not
yet been granted to Ecgberht, p.
398, and that it was ‘about thirty
years ' since Aldfrith's death, who
died in A.D. 705, p. 401. The date
given in Waraeus' edition is Nov. 5,
indictione tertia, i.e. Aa). 734.
