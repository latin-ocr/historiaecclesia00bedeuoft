we are told that in his early boyhood he manifested a decided
preference for the monastic life. His career till he became a
Bishop was marked but by one event which is of importance
in English Church History. At the synod of Streaneshalh,
Wilfrith, then a priest of Bishop AEgelberht of Wessex, was
the advocate of the Roman practice with regard to the celebra-
tion of Easter. His arguments prevailed, and in consequence
the whole English Church adopted the Roman rule. He thus
took a principal part in deciding the question whether the
North English Church, which owed her hierarchy and existence
mainly to that of Scotland, should retain the elasticity of usage
which she had borrowed from the latter, or be rigidly subJected,
like her neighbour the South English Church, to the rules
which emanated from Rome.

After his consecration, we find Wilfrith’s influence all bearing
in the opposite direction. He apparently was content that the
North English Church should serve the Roman, but rebelled
against* the supremacy of the primate of Canterbury. His
influence now was not so successful as before. It was suffi-

at Rome3 yet it was not sufficient to last beyond his own
lifetime. ’

years 3 he converted Sussex and Wiht, not to speak of his
preaching in Fresia; he went thrice to Rome, the last time in
his seventieth year, upon matters which he must have thought
vital to the welfare of the Church of England.

A striking contrast to the stormy career of Wilfrith is
