habebantur, quia et inde barbarorum inruptio timebatur, turres
per intervalla ad prospectum maris collocant, et valedicunt sociis ¹
tanquam ultra non reversuris Quibus ad sua re· but the
meantibus, cognita Scotti Pictique reditus denega· Jalgss'fflffid‘ffn
tione, redeunt confestim ipsi, et solito confidentiores them.
facti, omnem aquilonalem extremamque insulae partem pro indi-
genis ad murum usque capessunt. Statuitur ad haecjn edito arcis
acies segnis 2, ubi trementi corde stupida die noctuque marcebat.
At contra non cessant uncinata hostium tela: ignavi propug-
natores miserrime de muris tracti solo adlidebantur. Quid plura 2
relictis civitatibus ac muro, fugiunt, disperguntur. Insequitur
hostis, adcelerantur strages ⁸ cunctis crudeliores prioribus, Sicut
enim agni, a feris, ita miseri cives discerpuntur ab hostibus:
unde a mansionibus ac possessiunculis suis ejecti, imminens sibi
famis periculum latrocinio ac rapacitate mutua temperabant,
augentes externas domesticisv‘motibus clades, donec omnis regio

totius cibi sustentaculo, excepto venandi'solatio, vacuaretur.

¹ valedicunt sociis] Probably ΑΒ. place from a very early period of the
418. ⁴ Spoliata Britannia auro argen· Roman occupation of the island,'

toque cum aere, et omni preciosa
veste et melle,' Nenn. 27. ⁶ This year
the Romans collected all the trea-
sures that were in Britain, and some
they hid in the earth, so that no one
has since been able to find them;
and some they carried with them
into GauL' S. Chron. ad a. 418.
That is, probably, the two legions
remaining in Britain, the sixth and

, twentieth, withdrew3 and the Roman

administration‚ as detailed in the
N otitia Imperii, came to an end.

² acies scynis] The legionary po-
pulation had belonged to all sorts of
different nations. See p. 7, note 4.
And this especially had been the
case along this wall, insomuch
that at the time of the Notitia there
were colonies of thirteen different
nations at the eighteen stations
along it. And these ⁶ were not bodies
of troops in temporary quarters
w'hich could be changed at pleasure‚’
bjit ‘ they had remained in the same

and ‘were possessors of the land?
Wright‚ p. 255. When then the
legions were suddenly summoned out
of Britain, in A.D. 418, the stations
along the wall, as well as many other
parts of Britain, must have been
depopulated as well as unmanned.
We can therefore well imagine what
was left being an ‘ acies segnis? ⁴
³ adcelerantur straqes] At Mary-

port, Gumberland, the arch of the
gate was found, A.D. 1766, beaten
violently down and broken3 and
marks of houses having been more
than once burnt down and rebuilt. At
Ribchester‚ Lancashire (supposed to
be the ancientcoccium), at the begin· v
ning of this century the temple of
Minerva was found to have been
burnt‚ and ‘among the debris were
found skeletons‚ no doubt those of
soldiers who had here made their
last stand against the assailants.

Wright, pp· 392, 393·
