functus erat, et necdum alius pro eo ordinatus episcopus. In
quam videlicet provinciam paulo ante, hoc est, ante praefatum
virum Dei Boselum‚ vir strenuissimus et doctissimus, atque
excellentis ingenii, vocabulo Tatfrid, de ejusdem abbatissae mona-
sterio electus est antistes : sed priusquam ordinari posset, morte
immatura praereptus⁴ est.

Non solum vero :praefata Christi ancilla et abbatissa Hild
quam omnes qui noverant ob insigne pietatis et gratiae matrem
vocare consueverant, in suo monasterio vitae exemplo praesentibus
exstitit: sed etiam plurimis longe manentibus, ad-quos felix
industriae ac virtutis ejus rumor 2-pervenit, occasionem salutis
et correctionis ministravit. Oportebat namque impleri somnium
quod mater ejus Bregusuid¹ in infantia ejus vidit: quae cum
vir ejus Η61·61’102 exularet sub rege Brettonum Oerdice ³, ubi
et veneno periit, vidit per somnium, quasi subito sublatum eum
quaesierit cum omni diligentia, nullumque ejus uspiam vestigium
apparuerit. Verum cum sollertissime illum quaesisset, extemplo
se reperire sub veste sua monile pretiosissimum ε quod dum at·
tentius consideraret, tanti fulgore ‘luminis refulgere videbatur,
ut omnes Brittaniae ‘fines illius gratia splendoris impleret.
Quod nimirum somnium veraeiterin filia ejus de· qua loquimur,

makes him the son of Eanfrith, pp.
124, 136, the son of Eadwine. But

566-575‚ Ann. Menev„ Angl. Sacr.
·ii. xxxi, and of a district called
Kemticiaun, now Gardigan. In
Elmet the name seems to have
been usual. Nennius tells us of a

the exile during which Eanfrith was
born to Eadwine by Cwenburh lasted
from Aa). 588 to A.D. 617, and Ead-
wine himself was born in ΑΛ). 585.
Puttin g Eanfrith’s birth then in AD.
605, we should have to suppose that
Hilda, his grand-daughter, was born
within ten years of her grandfather,
i. e. in ΑΛ). 614. The true solution
of this difficulty is Lappenberg's,
that ‘ nepos ' at the beginning of
this chapter has been mistaken by
Florence, and means⁴ nephew, not
grandson.

³ Cerdice] Oerdic seems to have
been a common name for British
kings. We hear of a ‘ Kereticus in-
felix ' as reigning in Wales from A.D.

Gerdic of Elmet who was interpreter
to Gwrtheyrn in his intercourse with
the Saxons, p. 65, M. H. B.; and,
in another passage, p. 76, M. H. R,
shews that the last king of Elmet
was called 0611110, who perhaps may
be the same with the Geretic who
died in A.1›. 616, Ann. Cambr. p. 6.
The name is written Cerdic‚ Cerdicce,
Ceretic‚ Keredig: and under these
latter forms we have no difficulty in
recognizing Caradwg, Caradoc. It
does not appear at all as a saxon
name till we find it in the Saxon
chroniole, ad a. 4959—a doubtful
authority for such early events. The
first king of the West Saxons men·
tioned by Beda is Ceaulin, p. 99.
