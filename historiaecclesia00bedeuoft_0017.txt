To return 1ο 1116 few facts which we know about Beda's
life. He tells us that he was born on* the (101116111- of the abbey
of Wearmouth and J arrow. The abbey at Wearmouth was
begun A.D. 674, 011 land given by Ecgfrith, King of North-
humberland, to Biscop Benedict. - The abbey at J arrow was
begun A.D. 682, on land given for th'e purpose by 1116 361116
king. But the year of Beda’s birth is a matter of uncertainty.
The two MS. Lives of him already referred to fix it A.D. 677.
Pagi1 places it in A.D. 674; Mabillon2 A.D. 6733 the editors
of the Monumenta Historica Britannica A.D. 672. But
Mabillon's reasoning seems incontrovertible. If it be true
that the History was written ΑΔ). 731, 11 follows that Beda,
being then in his fifty-ninth year, must have· been born in
ΑΛ). 673 or 672.

He was born then on the lands to 1116 north of the Wear,
which even then³ may have been destined by King Ecgfrith
for the ground on which the future abbey was to be built.
At seven years old he was put under the care of Abbot
Benedict by his relations. In A'.D. 684 Benedict, on his

⁶ going to Rome for the fifth time, made· Ceolfrid abbot of

J arrow, and Easterwine of Wearmout'h. Ceolfr'ith ultimately
became abbot of both, as he succeeds-d Sigfrith, Easterwine’s
successor, in A.D. 688· ; but as Beda in his short autobiography
makes no mention of either Eastcrwine or Sigfrith, we must
conclude 11161 116 was· bred up in the abbey of St. Paul at
Wearmouth. He proceeds—‘I have passed all my life, since
then in the same monastery, and have given my whole attention
to studying of 1116 Scriptures; and in the intervals of my observ-
ance of the monastic discipline and of the daily occupation
