where Beda's mistake is accounted
for. There was, however, a vallum
already in existence a few yards to
the south of this line, built by Ha-
drian, AEl. Spartian. de Adriano,
c. 11. The existing remains shew
three lines of rampart, all of which
Merivale supposes to be included
under the name ‘vallum.' Article
on the Roman wall, Quarterly Re-
view‚ J an. 1860. ‘The triple line
of earthen rampart, with the fosse
immediately connected with it, com-
mences at Newcastle, and terminates
at Burgh-on-the-Sands‚ a little be-
yond Carlisle. . . . On the other
hand, the wall, or murus, with its
ditch, commences at Wall’s End,
four miles further east, and is con-
tinued to Bowness‚ about as much
further west. Though preserving
the general direction of the vallum,
the parallelism between the two
works is not always accurate, even
where there seems no reason for a
divergence from the nature of the
ground ; but it may be observed
that, while the vallum runs along
the sloping sides of the hills, and
sometimes in the valleys below them,
the murus uniformly seeks the ridge
of the eminence‚ and in some parts
of the line leaves the vallum at a
distance of more than half a mile,
in order to preserve this vantage
ground.’

² conlocarunt] Bruce, Roman
wall, pp. 350-369, contends that

the unity of desig-n between the
‘- vallum’ and the ‘ murus ’ forbids the
idea of more than one builder‚ whence
he concludes that they both are
Hadrian's work. Merivale more pro-
bably refers the ‘ murus ' to the time
of Theodosius and Stilicho, thinking
that Theodosius might have begun
it in A.D. 369, and the Roman legion
might have completed it before its
departure. Quart. Rev. pp. 144,
145. But, since Theodosius had
just constituted the province of
Valentia north of this isthmus in
A.D. 369, and since we know-of one
southern migration of the Picts to
the north of this line about Λα). 380,
that of Cunedag, from the Lothians
to North Wales, Nenn. M. H. Β. p.
75, it is perhaps more probably still
all referable to the age of Stilicho.
Why should not Chrysanthus, the
vicar of Britain about A.D. 400, who
ἐθαυμάσθη ἐπι ταῖς διοικήσεσι, Socr.
vii. 1 2, p. 751, have been the designer
of this great work ’ἒ

4 duodecim altwm] ‘ We may con-
jecture that the height was originally
greater, and that the parapet‚ at
least, had been overthrown in the
time of Bede. . . . We may conclude
that, with its parapet, it was gene-
rally above twice as high as it was
thick, or from sixteen to eighteen
feet. In the portions which now
remain it rarely exceeds five or six
feet in6heightn’ Quart. Rev. pp.
