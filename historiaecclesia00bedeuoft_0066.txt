Historia Ecclesiastica [Lm. 1.

facinoribus sua colla, abjecto levi jugo Christi, subdentes.
Interea subito corruptae mentis homines acerba pestis corripuit,
quae in brevi tantam ejus multitudinem stravit ut ne sepeliendis
quidem mortuis vivi sufficerent: sed ne morte quidem suorum
nec timore mortis, hi qui supererant a morte animae qua
peccando sternebantur, revocari poterant: unde non multo
post acrior gentem peccatricem ultio diri sceleris secuta est.

Initum namque est consilium quid agendum, ubi quaerendum
esset praesidium ad evitandas vel repellendas tam seras tamque

creberrimas gentium aquilonalium inruptiones : placuitque
omnibus cum suo rege Vurtigern0¹ ut Saxonum gentem (16
transmarinis partibus in auxilium vocarent: quod Domini nutu
dispositum esse constat, ut veniret contra inprobos malum, sicut
evidentius rerum exitus probavit. ’ ’

as he was called in British, Latinized
into Vortigernus, and Saxonized into
Wyrtgeorne, seems, if we may trust
Nennius, to have been one of a line
of princes who ruled ’111 South wales,
M. H. B. p. 71. He succeeded in A.D.
42 5, a date N ennius positively fixes
by making it contemporary with the
accession of Valentinian‚ M. H. B.

his rival Ambrosius on the other,
M. H. B. p. 62, he made a treaty with
the invading Saxons, and. so was re-
garded by both nations with hatred,
as the betrayer of his country. The
treaty did not last; he fought with-
out suecess, and fied into a fastness

which he had built for himself in
the wilds of his native Radnorshire,
M. H. Β. p. 68. There, it is asserted
miraculous1y‚ and at the prayer of
St. Germanus who had rebuked his
crimes, he died, M. H. Β. p. 70. No-
thing occurs to fix the date of his
death ε we are only told it was before
the return of Germanus to Gaul,
M. H. Β. p. 71 ; but we do not know
when Germanus returned after his
first visit, and only that his second
return was very shortly before his
death in ΑΛ). 448.
