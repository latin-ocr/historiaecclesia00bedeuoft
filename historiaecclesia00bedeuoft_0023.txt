Introduction.

Beda was buried at J arrow, where the following 'inscription

was placed over his tomb :--

‘Presbyter hic Beda requiescit carne sepultus,

Dona, Christe, animam in caelis gaudere per aevum.

Daque illi sophiae debriari fonte, cui jam

Suspiravit ovans intento semper amore?

A few words must be added about ‘the sources from which the
texts of the documents printed in this volume are derived.

The text of the Cburch History is that of Smith‚ cor·
rected in a few places by that of the Monumenta Historioa
Britannica, the Introduction of which however testifies in the

strongest manner to the general correctness of Smith’s text.

On questions as to one or two isolated words I have referred

directly 'to the great Moore MS. in the University Library at
Cambridge ¹, which Ι have been enabled to consult through

¹ This MS. seems to have been
written ΑΛ). 737, two years after
Beda’s own death. This appears
from certain chronological notes
which are made at the end of the
MS. which, without actually giving
the date, state the number of years
since various events happened,
thus—

‘ Baptizavit Paulinus ante an. cxi„

Eclipsis ante an. lxxiii.

Penda moritur ante an. lxxix.

Pugna Ecgfridi ante an. lxiii.

AElfuini ante an. lviii.

Monasterium aet Uiuraemoda ante
an. lxiv.

Conietae visae ante an. viii.

Eodem an. pater Ecgberct trans-
ivit ad Christum.

Angli in Brittania ante an. ccxcii.'

We know the dates of all these nine
events. Assuming the starting—point
to be ΑΔ). 737, the great eclipse is
properly dated m). 664 (p. 202),

AElfwine’s death A.D. 679 (p. 258),
and Ecgberht's death ΑΛ). 729 (p.
{1⁵31ss οῗαξὲἑῖιῗε Αἶῆεῠὲοῌεὲἱῗῗῗ
no dd'ubt baptized A.D. 6256, though
Eadwine’s baptism was not till the
next year. In ΑΒ. 684 Ecgfrith
made war on the Irish (p. 275), not
in A.D. 6743 but as no other ‘Pugna
Ecgfridi ’ is mentioned, perhaps ‘ ante
an. lxiii ’ may be a misreading for
‘ante an. 1iii.’ There remain only
the foundation of Wearxnouth Abbey,
which really took place ΑΙ). 674
instead of A.D. 673 (p. 374); and
Penda’s death, which is clearly dated
four years too late—Am. 658 instead
of A D. 654.

This MS. was preserved in France
till the Peace of Ryswick‚ A.D. 1697,
when it passed into the hands of
Bishop Moore [Morus] of Ely‚ who
gave it to the elder Smith to use for
his edition, which appeared in AD.
1722 under the auspices of his son.
