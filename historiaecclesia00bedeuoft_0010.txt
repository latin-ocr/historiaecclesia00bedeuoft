vi Introduction.

The theory which was once received without question, that
the Anglo-Saxon conquest had been a war of ex-

Οὶιῗέἲίἰηε termination, and that all the Britons who were

mzrggvgpgyas left alive took refuge in Wales, Cornwall, or Cum-

’Μεθ’ berland, is now generally abandoned. Whatever
may be thought as to the numerical proportion, or capacities,
in which Britons continued to inhabit England, there is now
no 'reason to doubt that there was still to be found a Celtic
stratum, overlaid doubtless by many Teutonic strata, among
the population. There would be more reason to believe this
if, as is probable, the Anglo-Saxon conquest did not begin in
Λα). 450, according to the popularly received story, but con-
sisted of a gradual extrusion of the old inhabitants and colon-
ization of the conquered territory, lasting perhaps for a period
little short of three centuries. Such Britons as remained then
under Anglo-Saxon rule would have been Christians. They
may more than possibly have soon lost their Christianity3 and
it is not to be expected that a race of warlike lords would
have brooked the teaching of their inferiors and serfs. But
at any rate, though we estimate the influence which Christianity
gained in this way at the lowest, this will still account for the
fact that Christian ideas, when presented by any but foes, were
no novelty to the English Teutons.

Another consideration of weight should be added to the
‚rh Τ foregoing. The Teutonic mythology was not so
ssdgrgffil‘ss degraded but that it presented in fragments the
way-sor outlines of the 'Christian scheme of salvation. ‘The
chmtmmty. fact that a god had perished could sound strangely
in the ears of no worshipper of Baldr ; the great message of
consolation—that he had perished to save sinful, suffering
man—justified the ways of God, and added an awful meaning
to the old mythus. An earnest, thinking pagan would, I must
believe, joyfully accept a version of his own creed, which offered

so inestimable a boon in addition to what he had heretofore
