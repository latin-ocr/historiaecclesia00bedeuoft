1. ELIGIOSUS Christi famulus Biscopus¹ cognomento

Benedictus, aspirante superna gratia, monasterium
construxit in honorem beatissimi apostolorum principis Petri,
juxta ostium fluminis Vyri ad aquilonem, juvante se ac terram
tribuente venerabili ac piissimo gentis illius rege ngrido:
idemque monasterium annis sedecim, inter innumeros vel itine-
rum vel infirmitatum labores, eadem qua construxit religione,
sedulus rexit. Qui ut beati papae Gregorii verbis ², quibus
cognominis ejus abbatis vitam glorificat, utar: ‘ Fuit vir vitae
venerabilis, gratia Benedictus et nomine, ab ipso pueritiae suae

does not attempt to explain the name z
‘Biscop is certainly a strange name
to be borne by one who never enjoyed
the episcopal dignity: it is impos·
sible to explain it, but I must call
attention to the fact that it occurs
in the ancient genealogy of the kings
of Lindissi, among the names of
Woden's descendants. They were
probably Mercians. If Biscop were
a descendant of that race, “stirps

tus may have been only an additional
name derived from his familiarity
with, and frequent pilgrimages to
Rome. A similar instance may be
noticed in Beorhtgils, a bishop of
East-Anglia, who was also called
Boniface; and in the celebrated St.
Boniface himself? Thorpe thinks
that the Biscop of the royal race of
Lindissi is the same with Benedict.
And it is a curicus fact that his
father’s name is given as ‘Beda.'
