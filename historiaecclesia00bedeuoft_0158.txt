² Earpualdo] Eorpwald. At least

twenty-five years intervened between
his baptism and Honorius?- death in
ΑΒ. 653. And it is probable that
the interval was longer, and that
Eorpwald was baptized not later
than A.D. 626: for his death hap-
pened ‘non multo post3' and then
Rioberht usurped the throne for
three years before Sigberht suc-
ceeded. But Bishop Felix, who died
in A.D. 646, having been bishop
seventeen years, iii. 20, was conse-
crated by Sigberht’s 'appointment,
iii. 18. We may therefore date
Eorpwagd's baptism with probability

his having had Christians at his court.

³ Alduulf] This was probably
heard from Ajdwulf's lips by Esi,
Beda’s informant about East-Anglia.
