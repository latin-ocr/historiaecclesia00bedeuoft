xii Introduction.

presented to us in the quiet and uneventful life of the

and the Venerable Beda. We know, to say the truth, very

vagg-:ple little about him. All the factS, with the one ex-
ception of the account of his death, are gathered from his own
short autobiography at the end of his history. Two lives are
extant of him, but they neither of them appear to have had
any materials to build upon further than this. One of these
was written in the eleventh century—the other is of uncertain
date ¹. ·

Beda's name has commonly been derived from ‘ bidan,' to
bid ; which may be taken either in an active or a passive sense
—as meaning either a ‘master' or ‘a servant,’ either ‘ to
command’ or ‘ to pray.' There is another stem, however, from
which it seems likelier to have come. We find in Florence
of VVorcester's Appendix a King of Lindsey named Beda,
with a son Biscop ; and it is impossible not to be struck with
the coincidence that Haedde calls Biscop Benedict‚ the founder
of Wearmouth and J arrow, by the name of Baducing, or the
son of Badoc. Here, it seems, among the Kings of Lindsey
(who Kemble thinks were probably Mercians 2), occurs the name
of another Biscop Baducing. If Biscop Benedict was de-
scended from the same stock, it would well suit Beda's expres·
sion that he was ‘nobili quidem stirpe Anglorum progenitus!
And we also have the name of Beda occurring as one of the
same race. If this Beda is equivalent to Badoc, as seems not
improbable, we are at once introduced to a new idea; for Beda, ·
as a prefix, qualifies the word which follows it with the sense
of ‘ military ⁷—Badudegn‚ ‘battle-thane 3 ' Baduwine, ‘battle-
friend ³!
