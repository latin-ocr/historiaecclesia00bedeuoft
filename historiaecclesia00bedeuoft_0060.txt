was this more than a vallum, being
made of earth, not of stone .(p. 16).

Friths of Forth and Clyde.

² domum . . . reversa est] Probably
at the close οἵω). 402, when Stilicho
summoned the legions on foreign

service to the defence of Italy against
Alaric. Cf. Claudianus, De Bell.
Get. 416 :—
‘Venit et extremis legio praetenta
Britannis, ,
Quae Scoto dat frena truci.'

³ murum] Three systems of forti-
·fication closed the line between the
friths. 1. Agricola built detached
forts along it to keep out the Picta,
ΑΛ). 120. 2. Lollius Urbicus joined
these forts by an earthen wall, called,
after the reigning emperor, Vallum
Antonini, AD. 140. 3. The Britons
on this occasion built a ‘ murus cespi-
ticius.’ ⁶ It consists of three parts:
a large ditch, a rampart with its
parapet behind it, and a military
way behind both, running generally
through the middle of the stations
‘that' are appuyed >to the wall.’ ‘Roy’s

‚ Military Antiquities ofGreat Britain,

p. 156. The vernacular name for
this wall is Grim's Dyke.

4 Fecerunt] This wall was built
*across the northern isthmus3 in the
same place where Antoninus and

stony ground, the Romans used the
stones to form a foundation to their
wall, laying the stenes in due order
for that purpose.’ Roy, Milit. Antiq.
of G. B. p. 156.

British wall.

⁶ plurima] 39} Roman, and up-
wards of 36 English miles. Roy, p.

it 32 miles; so too Eutropius, viii.

canon. There are no remains of
a monastery.

⁸ Peanfahel] The Durham inter-
polator of Nennius gives this name
in three dialects ; Pictish, Pengaaul ;
Scottish, Cenail; British, Penel-
tun. The Kymric ⁴ p ’ changes into
the Gaelic ‘ k ' or ‘ c ’ (as in Caerpen-
talloeh‚ now Kirkintilloch) ; and the
Kymric word ‘ gaaul ’ (which is sim·
ply ‘ wall ') loses its first consonant
in Gaelic. Camden thinks that the
name is Walton, that of a village
