on his baptism; p. 239. It fell into
the hands of Ceadwalha of Wessex
when he conquered the rest of Sus-
sex3 and he permitted wilfrith to
evangelizo it3 p. 246. The date of
the conquest of Wiht by Ceadwalha
is ΔΛ). 686. S. Chron. Wilfrith's
evangelization of Wiht is not men-
tioned by Haedde.

¹ sedem suam] York. S. Hexham,
Flor. ad a. 686. He became recon-
ciled to Theodorus, who restored
friendly relations between him and
AEthelred of Mercia, who made him
bishop of Lichfield3 and afterwards
between him and Aldfrith of N orth-
humbria. Haedde, 42, 43.

² ipso φερε invitante] Haedde, on
the contrary, says, 43, that Aldfrith,
in his second year, which began
May 20, A.D. 686, invited Wilfrith
to his court, and ‘post intervallum
temporis ’ made him bishop of York.
According to Flurence, ad a. 691,
he was only bishop of Hexham when
he was driven out3 but he also
served the bishopric of Lindisfarne
for two years, ΑΛ). 686-688.

³ pulsus est] See p. 311. Haedde
gives three causes of quarrel: that
Aldfrith had despoiled the See of
York of its possessione ; that, by the

change of Ripon from a monastery
into a see, it had been nominally
brought under the jurisdiction of the
archbishop; and that wilfrith would
not acknowledge the jurisdiction of
the archbishop of Oanterbury. He
fied to Mercia, where he succeeded
to the vacant bishopric. From thence
he was summoned to attend a synod
at Onesterfeld (Nesterfield‚ near Rip-
on Ξ), which deprived him of all his
dignities, except the abbacy of Ripon;
after which he returned to Mercia.
Haedde, 44-46. John was reinstated
in Hexham. ‘ Post quinque annos,
Wilfrido iterum et Alfrido expulso,
illi sedibus suis restituti sunt ;' i.e.
Bosa to York, and John to Hexham.
Malmesb. Gest. Pontt. iii. 269.

⁴ veniensque Romam] Theodorus
excommunicated his adherente, which
drove him again to appeal in person
to the pope. Haedde, 48.

⁵ omnium judicio probatum est]
Haedde, 51. s

ὃεοννῂοευπηρτιε] Haedde. 5 2. Malmesb.
Gest. Pontt. iii. 267, and wilkins,
p. 68, also give this epistle.

⁷ diebus aliquot] His cause was
under trial during four months, and
seventy sessions of the council. Haed-

de, 51.
