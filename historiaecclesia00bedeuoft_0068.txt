¹ J atis] The name is variously
spelt, Gutae, J Ustaes Vitae, J etae,
Geata (Latinized into Geatani,
Giotae), Eoten [Iotnar], Jotun (La—
tinized into Jotuni). Beda in this
chapter, and Ethelwerd, M. H. B. p.
500, place the J utes north of the
Angle83 but it seems questionable
whether Geat was not rather a com-
plimentary name for all the An-
gles. The author of Be6wulf makes
no distinction between them what-
ever, Kemble’s Bedwulf, pp. xvi. 255.
Among the people of the north also
the name J ute, Eoten, was given to
‘ any being possessed of supernatural
strength, or defiled by supernatural
crime,’ p. 244. So ‘Eotenas’ are evil
spiritS‚,ranked with ‘ ylfe,’ elfs, line
22 3; and hence again the name was
given to any strange race ‘not im-
mediately connected with them-
selvesss p. 24 3. The J utes may pos-
sibly have been originally Frisians‚
(cf. the Strandfrisianffi living to the
west of the Cimbric Chersonese) ,whom
the Angles found 011 their immigra-
tion, and with whom they mixed.

² Vectam] The Isle ofWight was
called Vectis by the Romans; so that
its colonization by J utes or Vitae had
nothing to do with the naming of it.
Its inhabitants were called ‘ Wiht-
gare.’ The Vectiani are still known
as J uti, and distinguished from the

J uti Cantiani, about A.D. 900, Wal-
lingford, ap. Gale, i. 538.

³ et ea . . . Veccam] Omitted in the
Saxon Version. That which since
William the First’s time has been the
New Forest, was before it known as
the Ytena-land, or Eoum-wald, ‘the
weald of the J ntes? Perhaps too

of J utish origin are the Meanware, of
whom see iv. 13, and note there, who -., .
dwelt to the east of the Southamp- ·’

ton Water. In this case the name
Mean or Meon would be Kymric,
like Wiht and Cant.

4 antiquorum Saxonum] The Eald-
sexe of Beda’s time, Ethelwerd,
M. H. B. p. 502, also called Nordal-
bingia, Adam Brem. p. 63, seems to
have been nearly the modern Hol-
stein, including the three provinces
of Dithmarschen‚ Stormarn, and Wa-
grien. Three islands, N ordstrand,
Busen, and Helgoland, were also peo-
pled by the same tribe. Ptolem.

⁵ Anylis] ⁴ Anglia Vetus sita est
inter Saxones et Giotos, habens
oppidum capitale quod· sermone
Saxonico Slesuuic nuncupatur, se-
cundum vero Danos Haithaby:
Ethelwerd, M. H. B. p. 502. The
present province of Angeln extends

says the same of the islands from
which the Saxons came.
