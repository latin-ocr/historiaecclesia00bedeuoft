This would naturally be Elstree‚ of
which name there is a place in Herts;
but Beda's description of its situation
has caused it rather to be referred to
Aylesford in Kent, near which is a

¹ Henqist] For the existence of
Hengest we have the following
voucliers: (›1) N ennius, xxviii—xlix;

the Danish king, undertaking an

of the ‘ Battle of Finnesburh,’ a
poem apparently upon one of Hen-
gest’s exploits‚ the capture of Finnes-
burh, the capital of the Frisians.
Kemblc‚ Be6w. pp. xix, xxii, xxvii,
considers that these two last poems
were nearly contemporary with the
events they record, and that Beowulf
was ‘not far removed in point of
time from the coming of Hengest and
Hors into Britain.'

² in orientalibus.. dnsiynemennius,
M. H. B. p. 69, calls the place of battle
where Hors fell Episford; Britannice
‘Sathenegabail’=the Saxon battle.
The Saxon Chronicle, ad a. 45 5, calls
it AEgaeles-threp, and Henry of *Hun-
tingdon, M. H. B. p. 708, Ailestreu.

small village called Horsted. The
cromlech in the neighbourhood called
Kits-Coty House has been supposed
to be Hors’ monument; but this
would surely rather be Categirn's‚
[Gueit Catig]‚who, we are told, fell in
the same battle. Nenn. M. H. B. p. 69.

⁸ Erant . . . Voden,] The same
genealogy is given by N ennius,
M. H. B. p. 62, and by the S. Chron.,
M. Η. B. p. 299. Victgils is Hwitgisl‚
the ⁶ white pledge ;’ Vitta is Hwitdaeg,
‘white day ;' and Vecta is Waegdaeg,
‘ war day? On Woden, or Odin, see
Kemble, i. 335.

4 cum Pictis] No authority prior
to Beda makes the Saxons, in turning
upon the Britons‚ ally with the Picts.
Nennius‚ however, makes Hengest's
two sonS, Ochta and Abisa, ravage
the Orkneys, and settle among the
Picts, M. H. B. p. 66.

from Gild. xxiii-xxiv, except the
simile from the Chaldaean capture of
Jerusalem.
