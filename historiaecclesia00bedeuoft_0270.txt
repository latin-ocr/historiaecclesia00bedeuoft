¹ dissensione] What was the cause ‘

of this dissension? Eadmer makes
it originate with Archbishop Theo·
dorus. Simeon of Durham makes
Ecgfrith call in the archbishop‘s aid
to remove Wilfrith. Haedde makes
Queen Eormenburh the mover of the
whole. Malmesbury makes it arise
from the jealousy which Theodorus
felt lest Wilfrith should try to regain
the archbishop’s title for his See. See
Lapp. i. 180.

² pulsus] Lappenberg thinks that
Wilfrith's flight must be placed in
ΑΔ). 677, with Florence of Worcester,
as in the following spring he had an
interview with Dagoberht II of Au-
strasia, who was murdered in ΑΛ).
678; and that the date given here
may have reference to the consecra-
tion of his successors; i. 180, note.

³ hic . . . ille] ‘Hic' here, con-
trary to Latin usage, refers to Bosa,
who was bishop of York over the
province of Deira; ‘ille‚’ to Eata,
bishop over the province of Bernicia,
which was afterwards divided into
the Sees of Hexham and Lindisfarne;
see iv. 28.

⁴ Eadlzaed] He had accompanied
ceadda from N orthhumbria into
Kent‚ where he came to be conse-
crated, p. 205. He was driven from
his See in A.D. 678 ; and in ΑΛ). 679,
AEthelred‚ by the suggestion of Os-
here, ealdorman of the Hwiccas,

divided Saxwulf's See of Mercia .

into five: 1. Hwiccas (Worcester);

2. Lyccidfelth (Lichfield); 3. Mid ,
Angles (Leicester); 4. Lindisse (Sid- '

dena) ; 5.South Angles (Dorchester) ;
Florence, p. 622, M. H. B. On p.
624, Florence says: ‘ (Theodorus)
praesulatum Saxulfi in quinque pro-
vincias divisit: quibus sextam ad-
jecit ; ’ and Hussey suggests that by

the sixth is meant Hecana. See ζ
