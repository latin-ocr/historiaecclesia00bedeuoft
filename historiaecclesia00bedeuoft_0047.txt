assigned for the accession of Eleu·
therus is A.D. 171 ; so that, if we in-
terpret strictly, he was not· pope at
all during the joint reign of Aurelius
and Verus. But Aurelius associated
with himself his son L. Aurelius
Commodus in A.D. 1773 and Beda
very probably has confused the two
Commodi. The father and son reigned
jointly till ΑΒ. 180 ; we must there-
fore place the conversion of Lucius
somewhere within these three years.

¹ Lucius] On the probability of so
early a conversion of Britain, see
Tertullian, adv, J udaeos, vii. Wright,
who disbelieves in British Chris-
tianity altogether, admits that the
Christian monogram has been found
on a tesselated pavement at Framp-
ton in Dorsetshire. Celt‚ Roman,
and Saxon, pp. 302, 303. Beda is
the earliest authority for the name
of Lucius. The next is Nennius,
c. xviii, who calls him ‘agnomine
Levermaur, i. e. magni splendoris,

propter fidem quae in ejus tempore
venit.’ His real name was pro·
bably Llew, meaning ‘ light? History
of Christian Names, ii. 159 3 or
Lles, Usher. But Nennius ascribes
his conversion to Pope Evaristus,
ΑΛ). 100-1093 and owing to this
discrepancy the whole story has been
disbelieved.

² per ejus . . . efficeretur] Some, as
Lappenberg, Anglo-Saxon Kings,
i'. 48, misled by the British practice
as to the celebration of Easter,
have supposed that Britain was
converted, not from Rome, but from
the East. But see Gieseler, Kirchen-
geschichte, Per. ΙΙ. Div. ii. ch. 6.
ἐ ἑΖὸᾍξῗῖῖΘῗ] From Orosius, vii. 17,
but the distinction between a ‘ murus ’
and a ‘ vallum ’ is Beda’s own.
