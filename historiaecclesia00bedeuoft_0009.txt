INTRODUCTION.

ξ Ι. ΤΗΑΤ Anglo-Saxon England should have produced so
learned a divine and historian as the Venerable Beda, within
the first century after the introduction of Christianity, is surely
a remarkable fact, and one which may well claim attention at
the outset of a study of this his great historica] work.

During the last years of the sixth century, a line drawn from
Abercorn southward to Weymouth would not un- 'Phe

fairly have represented the two great divisions of {gffgZ-{alxffis

the island. These divisions were separated by -a Οῇἷῗέζῆῃ

difference of religion, as wellqas by a difference of stock. The
races which inhabited the north-western portion of the island
were Celtic, and had been Christianized; those which lived to
the south-east of this imaginary line were Teutonic‚j and were
still heathen. The Britons had been Christians from time
immemoria13 but their Christianity was of such a stern and
unforgiving character, that though they sent Ninian to evan-
gelize their kinsmen the Picts at the beginning of the fifth
century, while the Scots were converted by the Irish Columba
in the middle of the sixth, they had no thought of admitting
their old Teutonic enemies‚ who now possessed what had once

been their territory, to the privileges of Christian brotherhood
with themselves ¹.

¹ See Hist. Eccl. i. 22, p. 48. Christianum Deo miserante deside-
‘ Et hoc addebant, ut nunquam genti ranter velle converti, sed sacerdotes
Saxonum sive Anglorum secum Brit· e vicino negligere, et desideria eorum
taniam incolenti verbum fidei prae- cessare sua adhortatione succendere?
dicando committerent.⁹ See too See too the next letter, where Gre-
Greg. Epist. vi. 58: ‘ Pervenit ad gorius expresses himself in nearly the
nos Anglorum gentem ad fidem same words.
