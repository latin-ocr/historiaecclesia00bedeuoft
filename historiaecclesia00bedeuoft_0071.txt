tempestati superfuerat, occisis in eadem parentibus regium
nomen et insigne ferentibus. Hoc ergo duce vires capessunt
Brettones, et victores provocantes ad praelium, victoriam ipsi,
Deo favente, suscipiunt. Et ex eo tempore nunc cives, nunc
’ hostes vincebant, usque ad annum obsessionis Badonici montis,
quando non minimas eisdem hostibus strages dabant, quadra-
gesimo ¹ circiter et quarto anno adventus eorum in Brittaniam.

Sed haec postmodum.
OAP. XV11.2

Ut Germanus episcopus cum Lupo Brittaniam naviyans, et primo maris, et
postmodam Pelayianorum tempestatem divina· virtute sedaverit.

ANTE⁸ paucos sane adventus eorum annos haeresis Pelagiana
per Agricolam inlata ⁴, Severiani Episcopi Pelagiani filium, fidem
tory, by which to fix the date of the

siege of anr Badon. Usher and
Stevenson date the siege A.D. 520.

Nenn. p. 62. He was at war with
Guitolin in ΑΛ). 437. He survived
Gwrtheyrn, -who diod before A.D.

449, and possessed his kingdom after
his death, Nenn. p. 70. He is fre-
quently mentioned in the Welsh
triads, where he is called ⁶ Emrys
Wledig.’ He may have been the
founder of Amesbury, Ambres-byrig.
He has been thought to be the same
with the prince of N atanleod, Netley‚
whom Cerdic slew in A.D. 508, Guest,
Philolog. Trans. i. N 0. 2 ; Pearson, p.
56; but, if so, he must have been very
aged, and at any rate cannot have sur-
vived till the siege of caer Badon.

Beda has 11616 misunderstood Gildas’
words, which are as follows: ‘annum
obsessionis Badonici montis . ,qui
quadragesimus quartus, ut novi, oritur
annus, mense jam primo emenso, qui
jam et meae nativitatis est! These
words, literally translated, seem to
mean, ‘ the siege of Mount Badon, from
which the forty·fourth year is now re·
volving, as I know, the first month
being already gone, the same also
being the year of my own nativity
M. H. B. p. 15,and 59,Introd. Usher
first pointed out Beda’s mistake,
p. 2 54. Unfortunately‚ we cannot
date the composition of Gildas’ his-

The Annales Cambriae date it seventy-
two years after their own commence—
ment; and if we follow the Monu-
menta in placing this in A.D. 444, the
date will be A.D. 516. They also
connect with this event the name of
Arthur—-a name of which legend is
full, but which is never mentioned
elsewhere, except by the same An-
nales in ΑΛ). 537, recording his death
at the battle of Oamlann.

² CAP. XVII.] This and the four
next chapters are inserted, with a
few verbal alterations, from a Vita
S. Germani, by Constantius, given
by Surius, iv. 406. See too Heficus,
iii. 9, iv. Ι. Τ116 reason why Beda
inserted the Chapters here, out of the
order of time, is plain ; 116 shared the
mistaken notiori, which was prevalent
till lately, that there were no Saxons
in England till ΑΒ. 450.

³ Ante . . . annos] Prosper, M.H.B.
p. lxxxii, dates the introduction of
Pelagianism into Britain A.D. 429.

.’ Clint. F. R. Constantius dates it

differently.
