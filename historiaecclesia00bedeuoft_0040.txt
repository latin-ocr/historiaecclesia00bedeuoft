In primis autem haec

insula Brettones solum 1 a quibus nomen² accepit, incolas
habuit, qui de tractu Armoricanoss, ut fertur, Brittaniam advecti,
australes sibi partes illius vindicarunt.

Et cum plurimam insulae partem, incipientes ab austro,
possedissent, contigit gentem Pictorum de Scythia ⁴, ut perhi-
bent, longis navibus non multis oceanum ingressam circum-

usually called the Roman element to
the original Keltie basis, were Ger-
mans, Gauls, Iberians, διο. as the
case might be3 rarely pure Roman.
The N otitia utriusque Imperii, a docu-
ment referrible to some time subse-
quent to the reign of Valens—inas-
much as it mentions the province of
Valentia—gives us, as elements of
our legionary population,--

1. Germana: i. e. Tungricani, Tun-
gri, TurnacenseS, Batavi.

2. Gaals: Nervii (in three quar-
ters), Morini, Galli.

3. Iberians: Hispani.

4. Probable Slavonians: Dalmatae,
Daci, Thraces, Thaifalae.

5. Syri, and 6. Mauri!

nicae Insulae, by Latham.

² Bretcoms solam] Probably Celts
of the Kymric type ; although Meri-
³ vale, i. 404, supposes a Gaelic im-
migration before the Kymric one.
We must except the Belgae, whom
Caesar found in South Britain, and
describes as mostly Teutons, Β. G.
ii. 3. Merivale, i. 223, thinks that
they may have been Kymry who
became mixed with Teutons before
their immigration from the north of
France. See the matter well summed
up by Palgrave‚ Ang. Sax. Eng. p. 4.

² nomen] Brettones is but a cor-
ruption of Britanni, whence the name
Britannia. The name Britanni was
probably given by Iberian coasting-
voyagers. Its root is the Celtic ‘bri,'
strength ; but its form is undoubtedly
Iberic‚ sharing as it does the medial
syllable ‘ etan’ with other Iberic
nations t e. g. Aqu-itan-i‚ Lus-itan-i,
Maur-etan-i, διο. See Taylor’s Words

and Places, p. 60.

³ tracta Armoricano] ‘ Smith as·
sumes that by the words “ tractu
Armoricanffl Beda means modern
Bretagne, but this is by no means
clear when we remember the state·
ment of Caesar, B. G. vii. 57,
“ universae civitates quae oceanum
attingunt Gallorum consuetudine
Armoricae appellantur.'’ The word
Armorica, being compounded of
“ are,'’ before, and “more,’' the sea, is
consequently capable of a much wider
interpretation than has been assigned
to it.’ Stevenson.

4 Pictorum deScythia] Hence the
famous Pictish controversy; for Scy-
thia is a general name for the Scan-
dinavian continent. If we rely on
Beda's authority, we shall con sider the
Picts to be Scandinavians with Pin-
kerton and Latham. But they were
probably rather Celts of the Kymric
type, who, living beyond the pale of
Roman civilization‚ had maintained
their savageness of manners3 and
were the same who were known to
the Romans by the name of Caledonii
and Maeatae. It is not before the
fourth century that we hear of Picti;
and by this name probably ‘ the Ro-
mans meant merely painted people‚
without any consideration about their
race, language, or other ethnica]
specialties. It does not appear that
the Scots from Ireland were self-
painters, and hence the distinction.'

See too Scott, Periodical Criticism,
Works, xx. 301 ; Palgrave‚ Ang.
Sax. Eng. p. 7. They are known to
the Irish chroniclers by the name
of Oruithneach.
