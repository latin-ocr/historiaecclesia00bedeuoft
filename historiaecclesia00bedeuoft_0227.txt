How great was the variety of days
on which it was possible for Easter
to fall? After how many years was
it to be expected that the paschal
full moon would return to the same
day of the year?

This was the first point of contest
between the Churches. The Roman
Church calculated by a cycle of
eighty-four years; the Alexandrian
by one of nineteeu, which was
adapted to Christian use, probably
by Eusebius of Caesarea, from the
old Metonic cycle, The differences
{3521 {zpizsstgnt13033ffiedassfi

different days by the two Churches.

' This was the case till about ΑΔ).
460, when the Roman Church aban-
doned its cycle, and adopted one
fiamed by Victorius of Aquitaine
on the basis of the· nineteen years'
cycle hitherto in use in the Alexan-
drian Church. This measure set at
rest for ever the first question, which
concerned the beginning of the pas-
chal month. or the days in any given
year when the new and full moons
next aiter March 21st were to be
expected.

But the differences were not wholly
reconciled; for the Latins followed
canons or rules differing from the
Alexandrian, to determine on which
particular day within the paschal
month Easter Day might fall. Thus,
for example. the Latius asserted that
it might fall on any day from the 16th
of the paschal month to the 22nd;
the Alexandriana said that it could
not happen after the πει, and might
be as early as the 15th.

This dispute was healed by another
concession on the part of Rome.
About A.D. 530 Rome adopted the
cycle of one Dionysius Exiguus,
which was an improvement on the
Victorian, and so of course still
based on the Metonic cycle, but which
gave up the old Roman canons, and
adopted those of Alexandria. This
was the paschal rule which was
followed by Rome when Augustinus
brought the gospel to England.

It was to be expected that he
would find the British Church fol-
lowing a different rule from himself3
and such was the case. The Britons,
as also the Irish and the Scotch,
were still calculating by the old
Roman cycle of eighty-four years,
which Rome herself had abandoned
in the fifth century. But their canon
of interpretation differed from that
of Rome in this—that whereas the
Roman limits to the time when
Easter Day might fall extended from
the 16th to the 22nd of the paschal
mouth, they ruled that it might fall
on any day from the 14th to the zoth
of the same month. And so they
found themselves at issue no less
with the new than with the ancient
Roman practice ; for it was now the
rule of the whole Church to let
Easter Day sall on any day from the
15th to the 21st of the paschal
month. It is this difference of a
day which forms the whole subject-
matter of the prolonged contest
between the two Churches which
is detailed by Beda. See Smith,
Appendix No. ix. a, and references
there.
