³ carausius] He is made a Mena-
pian by Aurelius Victor, 39, a
Batavian by Eumenius, Panegyr.
in Gonst. 5. Anyhow he belonged
to one of the most northerly‚ and
therefore. most thoroughly Teuton-
ized, of the Belgio tribes. The
Batavi dwelt between the Rhine
and the Meuse; the Menapii be-
tween the Meuse and the Scheldt.
Carausius therefore was probably
himself a Teuton, which explains
his treacherous conduct towards
Rome on behalf of the Teutons.
He is celebrated in Ossianic legend.
as ‘ Oaros, king of ships! Upon his
influence on the later history, see

‘ Cum apud Bononiam per tractum
Belgicae et Armoricae pacandum
mare accepisset, quod tunc Franci et
Saxones infestabant! Eutrop. ix. 2 12

The Notitia, circ. A.D.400, mentions a .

Comes Litteris Saxonici per Britan-
nias; Carausius’ government seems
to have been over a corresponding
tract of country on the mainland.
The Littus Saxonicum in Britain
extended from the Wash to Hamp-
shire; that on the mainland is a
district ‘ about the size of Middlesex,
lying between Calais, Boulogne, and
St. Omer, in which the name of
almost every village and hamlet is
of the pure Anglo·Sax0n type?
Taylor’s Words and Places, p. 139.
There is another like district at
Caen, which extends as far as the,
islands at the mouth of the Loire.
Ib. p. 147.

⁵ artifici myliyentia] ‘ It cannot
be considered improbable that Oa·-
rausius calculated upon the assist-
ance of the Germane in this country,
as well as that of their allies and
brethren on the continent.’ Kemble,
i. 12. See, too, note in loc„ where
Kemble quotes a passage from Eume-
nius, Panegyr. in Const. 18, 19, to
shew that there were Franks among
the mercenaries of Allectus. That
there were Saxone and other Germana
in England, see Kemble, i. lor-16.
