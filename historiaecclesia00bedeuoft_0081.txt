¹ anno decimo quarto] Augustinus
probably started from Rome for the
first time in ΑΛ). 595, ii. 5. He set
> out the second time in ΑΔ). 596,
ν. 24, having returned in the 111-
terval, and lauded in England, A.D.
5927’21c2292it5‘stinum] Augustinus had
been an alumnus of Felix, bishop of
Messana, Epp. xiv. 17, and at this
time was provost of the monastery
of St. Andrew ‘in clivo Scauri,’
which Gregorius himself had built
for the use of Benedictine monks,
Epp. viii. 30, Joan. Diac. Ι. vi, and
of which he himself had been first a
monk‚ and then abbot. See a life
of him by Gocelin, in Mabillon’s
Act. SS. Benedd. i. 498.

³ plures cum eo monachos] About
forty came into England, c. 25. But
Augustinus is bidden to take with him
‘aliquos presbyteros e vicino‚' from
Provence, and we do not know how
many may have joined the mission
on its second departure from Rome.
Those whom he originally took with
him are said to have been monks of
the abbey of St. Andrew. J oan.
Diae. ΙΙ. xxxiii.

⁴ praedicare] Gregorius had had
this in mind for some time. Of. the
story told of him at the end of c. 1,
lib.ii. A curicus letter of hisis extant,
in which he bids Candidus, the
governor of church estates in Gaul,
buy with some money sent therewith
either garments sor the poor, or some
Angle youths of seventeen or eigh-
teen, to be trained at monasteries in

Rome, evidently as future mission-
aries to England; and if the latter,
then to send with them a priest,
ready to baptize them, if they fell
sick on their way, Epp. vi. 7.

⁵ aliquantalum] They had gone
far enough to gather news of Pro-
tasius, bishop of Aix‚ and Stephanus,
bishop of Lerins‚ to which Gregory
alludes in the letters with which he
furnished Augustinus when he sent
him from Rome the second time.
So probably they halted in Provence,
not far from the islands of „Lerins‚
near the spot where the present town
of Oannes stands. The letters with
which Gregorius thus furnished Au-
gustinus, which were transcribed at
Rome by Nothelm for Beda, are all
to be found among his Epistles, and
Smith has collected them in his
Appendix, No. vi. From these we
may conjecture something of the route
taken by Augustinus. Gregorius
gives him letters to the bishops of
MarseiUe, Aix, Arles, Vienne, and
Autun; all within the kingdom of
Burgundy. Burgundy and Austra-
sia were ruled at this time by two
brothers, Theodoric and Theode berht,
minors, under the care of their grand-
mother Brunehaut‚ to all three of
whom Gregorius gives letters, though
Metz, the capital of Austrasia‚ would
hardly lie in the direct road to
Britain. After leaving these friendly
domnione, their course is more un-
certain; but we have a letter ad-
dressed to the bishop of Tours, and
we are told by Gocelin, Vita Au-
