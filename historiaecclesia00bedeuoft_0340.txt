Vilbrord 1 presbyterii gradu et merito praefulgebat. Qui cum
illo advenissent ², erant autem numero duodecim 3, divertentes ad
Pippinum ducem Francorum, gratanter ab illo suscepti sunt:
et quia nuper citeriorem Fresiam 4, expulso inde Rathbedo
rege, ceperat, illo 608 ad praedicandum misit3 ipse quoque
imperiali auctoritate juvans, ne quis praedicantibus quicquam
molestiae inferret3 multisque eos qui fidem suscipere vellent
beneficiis adtollens: unde factum est, opitulante gratia di-
vina, ut multos in brevi ab idolatria ad fidem converterent
Christi.

Horum secuti exempla duo quidam presbyteri de natione
Anglorum, qui in Hibernia multo tempore pro
aeterna patria exulaverant, venerunt ad provinciam

³ duodecim] An account is given
in Surius, ii. 5, of this mission, with
the names of all the twelve, by one
Marcellinus, who reckons himself the
twelfth, the other eleven being Wil-
brord‚ Swithberht‚ Acca, Wihtberht,
willibald, Winibald‚ Lebuin, the
two Hewalds, Werenfrid, and Adal-
berht, a deacon. But Marcellinus
seems to be quite untrustworthy3 for
the two Hewalds are mentioned be-
low as having followed the example
of these twelve, 111 6 mission to the
Ealdsexe. Wihtberht, who accord-
ing to him was slain by Rathbede.
probably (see end of last chapter)
never left Ireland after his return
from Fresia; and Acca, who, he
says, was made bishop of Hexham
by Wilfrith, whom in fact he suc-

have passed through Fresia.

⁴ citeriorem Fresiam] 111 relation
to what country was this Fresia
‘ citerior’2 Smith thinks that it may
be Holland, which would be nearer
to England than what was commonly
called Fmsia, beyond the Zuyder
Zee3 or the country watered by the
Meuse and the WaaL which might
be called ‘ Hither Fresia' by the
Franks„ The Annals of Metz, in
a passage extracted from Du Chesne
by Hussey, seem to favour this latter
view, saying, ‘ B. Pipinum ducem
seniorem avum hujus, populum inter
Oarbonariam Silvam et Mosam flu·
vium et usque ad Fresiorum fines
vastis limitibus habitantem, justis
legibus gubernasse.’ The Annales
Xantenses have, under A.D. 694,
‘Pippinus dux 'Ratbodum ducem
Fresonum bellando vicit, Fresiamque
sibi subjugavit, et S. willibrordum,
a beato Sergio papa consecratum,
illuc ad praedicandum verbum Dei
direxit. S. vero Adalbertus in loco
qui dicitur Ekmunda usque ad tem-
pus exitus sui apud quendam Eggo-
nem mansit.' Pertz‚ ii. 220. See

cueil des Historiens des Gaules et de
la France, ii. 680.
