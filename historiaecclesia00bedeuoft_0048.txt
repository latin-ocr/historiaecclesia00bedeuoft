16 Historia Ecclesiastica [LIB. 1.

saepe gestis, receptam partem insulae a caeteris indomitis
gentibus, non muro, ut quidam aestimant, sed vallo distinguendam
putavit ¹. Murus ² etenim de lapidibus, vallum vero quo ad
repellendam vim hostium castra muniuntur fit de cespitibus,
quibus circumcisis, e terra velut murus exstruitur altus supra
terram, ita ut in ante sit fossa, de qua levati sunt cespites,
supra quam sudes de lignis fortissimis praefiguntur. Itaque
Severus magnam fossam firmissimumque vallum crebris insuper
turribus communitum, a mari ad mare duxit: ibique apud
Eboracum oppidum morbo obiit. Reliquit duos filios, Bassianum
et Getam: quorum Geta hostis publicus judicatus interiit;
. Bassianus Antonini cognomine adsumpto, regno potitus est.

¹ vallo distinyuendam putavit]
Where this vallum was built, Beda
discreetly leaves in doubt. In
c. xii, however, he implies that
it was across the lower isthmus,
from the Tyne to the Solway Frith,
following Orosius, who here has led
him into a mistake; for undoubt-
edly it was across the northern
isthmus, between the Friths of
Forth and Olyde, that Severus built
his vallum.

The history of the Roman fortifi-
cations in Britain up to this time
is as follows 2—1. Agricola built de-
tached forts along both isthmuses,
Tacit. Agr-ic. 22, 233 A.D. 80, 81.
2. Hadrian built a wall eighty miles
long; therefore across the southern
isthmus, AEl. Spartian. de Adriano,
11, ΑΛ). 120. 3. Antoninus, through
his legate Lollius Urbicus, built a
wall of turf, A.D. 140. J ul. Capitolin.
de Antonino Pio, 5. The place is
identified with the northern isth-
mus by inscriptions. See Wright,
p. 100, note. 4. Severus built a
‘ vallum‚’ called a ‘murus ' by AEl.
Spartian. de Severo, 18, A.D. 207—
210; but across which isthmus?
Aurelius Victor, Epit. 20, settles
this question by giving its length
as ‘ xxxii’ miles, which accords al-
most exactly with the length of the
northern isthmus. EutropiuS, Ἧι).

19, copies 4melius3 but Orosius,
{tissi} {tzntffisffissssfflfffttiyffiff
ern wall, gives the length ‘cxxxii'
miles, thus making the mileage as
much too long sor the southern wall
as 1t was before too short; had he
put an ‘l’ instead of a ‘ c‚' he would
have been nearer the mark. The
Latin translator of Eusebius, Chron.
lib. ii, Cassiodorus, Chron.‚ and
Nennius, 19, follow Orosius and
make the same mistake; though
N ennius refers Severus' work to
the northern isthmus, giving at the
same time the erroneous mileage of
Orosius.

times quite recent as the Gual Sever,

tinction between ‘murus’ and ‘val-

lum ’ is added of Beda’s own.
