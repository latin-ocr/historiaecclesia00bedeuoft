possessed. The final destruction of the earth by fire could
present no difficulties to those who had heard of Sustr and the
Twilight of the godS, or of Allfather's glorious kingdom, raised
on the ruin of the intermediate divinities. A state of happiness
or punishment in a life to come was no novelty to him who
had shuddered at the idea of Nastrond: Loki or Grendel had
smoothed the way for Satan ¹.’ Pope Gregorius saw this, and
enjoined Augustinus not needlessly to shock the religious saith
of his convertS. They might still worship, he thought, the old
objects under new names, and in the old temples newly con-
secrated. ‘ Those who had believed in runes and incantations
were satisfied with the efficacy of the mass; a crowd of saints
might be invoked in place of a crowd of subordinate divinities;
the holy places had lost none of their sanctity ; the holy build-
ings had not been levelled with the ground, but dedicated in
another name ; the pagan sacrifices had not been totally abo-
lished‚ but only converted into festal occasions, where the new
Christians might eat and drink, and continue to praise God ;
Hrethe and Eostre, Woden, Tiw and Fricge, Thunor and
Saetere retained their places in the calendar of months and
days3 Erce was still invoked in spells3 Wyrd still wove the
web of destiny 3 and while Woden retained his place at the
head of the royal genealogies, the highest offices of the Christian
Church were offered to compensate the noble class for the loss
of their old sacerdotal functions. How should Christianity fail
to obtain access when Paganism stepped half-way to meet it,
Ι and it could hold out so many points of outward union to
Paganism22’ ⁴

Oonsiderations such as these may help to account for the
deep root which Christianity struck in England at once, and
the rapidity with which it bore fruit.
