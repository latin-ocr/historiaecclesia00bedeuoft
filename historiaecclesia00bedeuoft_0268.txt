etiam cervical posset interponi, a parte vero pedum, mensura

OAP. XII.

Ut episcopatum Occidentalium Saxonum pro Leucherio Haeddi, episcopatum
Hrofensis ecclesiae pro Putea C'wichelm, et pro ipso Gefmund acceperit:
ετ qui tunc N ordanhymbrorum fuerint episcopi.

QUARTUS Occidentalium Saxonum antistes Leutherius fuit.
Siquidem primus BirinuS, secundus Agilberctus, tertius ex-
stitit Vini. Cumque mortuus esset Coinvalch, quo regnante
idem Leutherius episcopus factus est ¹, acceperunt subreguli²
regnum gentis, et divisum inter se tenuerunt annis circiter
decem: ipsisque regnantibus defunctus est ille, et episcopatu
functus est Haeddi³ pro eo: consecratus a Theo-
doro in civitate Lundonia. Cujus episcopatus

Haedde
succeeds
Hlothhere

as bishop 01’ tempore devictis atque amotis subregulis, Caedualla

Wessex
[Am. 676,

S. Chron.].

¹ factus est] Hlothhere, Bishop
AEgelberht's nephew, was conse·
crated in A.D. 670. ·

² subreyuli] AEscwine and Cent-
wine; but they are not called ‘ subre-
guli,' nor is any mention made of a
partition of the kingdom, by the
Saxon Chronicle‚ which is the best
informed authority upon the affairs
of Wessex. According to that, Gen·
walh died in ΑΛ). 672, after which
his widow Saxburg reigned, till,
in ΑΛ). 674‚—on her death, says
Malmesbury‚—AEscwine succeeded,
a distant cousin of the late king.
He died in A.D. 676, when Oentwine,
a brother of Cenwalh, succeeded
and reigned till A.D. 685.

³ Haeddi] Archbishop Theodorus,
in one of his Decreta, praises Bishop
Haeddi thus: ⁶ cujus labore ac studio

suscepit imperium :

et cum duobus annis hoc ten-

uisset, tandem superni regni amore compunctus

apostolicoque mandato ex tunc primo

confirmata est in ipsa civitate [Ven- ⁴

tana] sedes episcopalis dignitatis.'
He translated the remains of Birinus

from Dorchester to winchester, under .

authority from Pope Agatho. He
was very fond of the abbey of Glaston-
bury,t0which he gave many gifts. He
died in A.D. 703, S. Chron.; A.D. 704,
Westminster 3 A. D. 705, Florence‚
and was buried at Glastonbury ‘in

pyramide saxea quondam nobiliter

exsculpta.’ Magna Glaston. Tabula, ,

quoted by Usher„ p. 59. He is not
the same with the author of a Life
of Wilfrith of York, to be found in
Gale's Script. Angl. i. 40; nor with
Haedde (Headda), who was made
bishop of Lichfield and Leicester
after Saxwulf.
