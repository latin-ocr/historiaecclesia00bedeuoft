xx Introduction.

the great ,courtesy and kindness of the Librarian‚ Mr. H. Brad-
shaw. While bearing the same testimony with others to the
aocuraoy of Smith’s general text, he has been kind enough to
collate the Moore MS. throughout as to the proper names,
whether Latin or Saxon, all of which Smith had reduced to a
standard Latin form. To his kindness also I am indebted for
note 1 on p. 75, note 2 on p. 269, and note 1 on p. 270.

The texts of the other three documents are based upon
Smith’s, to be found in his edition. That of the Historia
Abbatum was from a MS. in the Bodleian Library (Fairfax‚ 6);
that of the Letter -to Ecgberht from one in Merton College
Library3 and that of Boniface’s Letter to Cuthberht from the·
text to be found in Serarius' edition of Boniface's Letters.
These have all been collated afresh with their originals, and
found -to exhibit no important variation from them. The Letter
to Cuthberht, however, is incomplete in Serarius’ edition, and
the concluding portion is given from Spelman's Concilia Bri-
tannioa.

My best thanks are due to the Rev. W. Stubbs‚ Regius Pro-
fessor of Modern History‚ for the hindness with which he has
looked over the sheets as they came from the press, and the
valuable suggestions which he has from time to time made.
